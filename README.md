- 👋 Hi, I’m @KetanRaje
- 👀 I’m interested in IT projects, DevOps, trading and travelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/practicing DevOps by implimenting in my organizations projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any DevOps related activities also for any sports events especially Table Tennis. 
- 📫 You can reach me on email: Ketanaraje@gmail.com, mobile: 9657661093, linkedin: linkedin.com/in/ketanraje 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I treat my life like a CI/CD pipeline—automate everything, test often, and always rollback gracefully when things break. 😄
